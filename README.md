If you want to do everything really well, here are some guidelines. Solutions should:
 - work with Python 3.6 or greater
 - not depend on third-party libraries (like `numpy`)
 - follow [python style conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
   - camel_case for everything except classes
   - descriptive, longer variable names
 - be formatted using the [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) code formatter
 - include tests to prove they work. [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) is supported
 - have a clean commit history ideally following the
 [angular commit message convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#type)
 and including the problem being worked on in parenthesis. For example `feature(C01_P04): added solution`.  The C01_P04
 referring to Chapter 1, Problem 4.  Look at our [commit history](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-Python/commits/master) for more examples:
